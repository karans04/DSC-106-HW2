            The Impossible burger is a plant based substitute for meat products. </br>
            We can see in the graph that our customers chose to switch to the healthier option. </br>
            We experience a <b>16.5%</b> drop in sales, the highest in the last three years. </br>
            We can see a slight improvement in sales after October, but we must roll out the <b>McPossible Burger </b> to compete with Burger King! </br>
            In the chart below, we can see that all regions faced the same trend. </br> 
            We faced the biggest drop in sales in the <b>South-West</b>. </br>
            If we were to release the McPossible Burger, we should first pilot it in the South-West, since they seem to be the most health conscious.</br>

                The Impossible burger is a direct substitute for beef. </br>
                Given that almost <b>60%</b> of our sales are from Hamburgers, we must adapt to the Impossible burger. </br>
                We will be able to open up to a whole new market of <b>Vegetarian</b> customers. </br>

                The average sales in October is due to the effect of the Impossible Burger. </br>
                Generally <b>January</b> and <b>March</b> are our worst months. </br>
                People make <b>New Years resolutions</b> to eat better and move away from hamburgers. </br>
                By releasing the McPossible Burger January 2020, we can help our customers with their New Years resolutions. </br>

                Our Fish-Filet Burgers tend to sell well on Fridays. </br>
                The sales continue to drop through the weekend until Tuesdays. </br>
                The reason for this is that <b>pescatarians</b> don't have any other alternatives at McDonalds. </br>
                We can provide deals on the McPossible Burger over the weekend to compensate for the drop in sales of the Fish Burger. </br>

            <h1>FINAL VERDICT</h1>
            
                    Time to develop the recipe for the McPossible Burger. </br>
                    <b>18%</b> of greenhouse emissions are due to the meat industry. </br>
                    It is time that McDonalds paid greater importance to saving our planet. </br>
                    Not to forget the long term health of our customers </br>
